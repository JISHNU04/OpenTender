# OpenTender
Block chain based e-tender system
OpenTender

OpenTender is a decentralized application which allows different organizations, such as government, to release tenders, with the help of HyperLedger. OpenTender prevents organizations from tampering or looking into the proposed amount of the contracts submitted by various contractors, for a given tender under a fixed deadline. OpenTender brings fairness and decentralization in the end-to-end process of tenders.

How OpenTender works?

    An organization issues a tender.
    Contractors are asked to submit the proposals of their applications/contracts onto the server until a fixed deadline.
    The proposed amounts are hashed using MD5.
    These hashes get stored, mapped with the Contractor's Company ID.
    Once the deadline is over, the system chooses the best proposal.
    The result is announced to everyone.

Future Scope of OpenTender.

    Contractor authentication, on the portal, and verification by the government agencies.
    Increase the scalability.
    Smart contracts between the government and the contractor, on the portal.
    More advanced algorithm for the selection process of the proposal.
