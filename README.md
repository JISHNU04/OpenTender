                                                          ABSTRACT
                                                          
                                      AucTender - Block chain based AUCTION and TENDER system
                                      
AucTender is a decentralized application which allows different organizations, such as government, to release tenders, with the help of HyperLedger. AucTender prevents organizations from tampering or looking into the proposed amount of the contracts submitted by various contractors, for a given tender under a fixed deadline. AucTender brings fairness and decentralization in the end-to-end process of tenders and auctions. An online auction platform based on blockchain would be great improvement over current auction systems. With the blockchain structure auction data and bids will be impossible to falsify. The platform will be transparent, reliable and scalable. With the help of this market anyone can place any item to auction and bidder can bid and buy items without any fraud 



Future Scope of AucTender 

• Contractor authentication, on the portal, and verification by the government agencies.

• Increase the scalability.

• Smart contracts between the government and the contractor, on the portal. 

• More advanced algorithm for the selection process of the proposal
